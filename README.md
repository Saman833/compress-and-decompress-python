# Huffman Coding Compression and Decompression

## Introduction
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm used for file compression and decompression. Huffman coding is an efficient algorithm for lossless data compression, and this implementation demonstrates how to use it to compress and decompress files.

## Features
- **File Compression:** Compress files using Huffman coding to reduce their size.
- **File Decompression:** Decompress files back to their original form.
- **Efficient Encoding:** Utilizes Huffman trees to encode and decode data efficiently.
- **Customizable:** Easy to adapt for different file types and data.
- **Testing Suite:** Includes two additional Python scripts for generating random tests to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the code.
